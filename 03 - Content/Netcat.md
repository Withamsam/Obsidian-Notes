# [[Netcat]]  
___

## Description:
Versatile tool that can allow us to use both TCP and UDP to either connect to another server or listen for incoming connections

## Installation


## Commands
### Connecting to a server
1. `nc <IP / HOSTNAME> <PORT>`
	- `nc 10.10.10.10 80`
2. Once it connects we need to send it commands this example is to banner pull
	- Might need to hit **Shift-Enter** if after last command it didn't put us on a new line.
	- `GET / HTTP/1.1`
	- This command tells the server we are connecting to that we accept HTTP 1.1 protocol
3. Next we need to give a name to our host
	- `host: netcat`
4. After entering this we should get our banner back from the site giving us more information about it
