## Description:  
This method involves scanning a network without directly interacting with the target device(computer, server etc.). This can be carried out a number of ways usually involving packet capturing and analysis using something like Wireshark.

Using this method often only provides basic asset information like OS version, network protocol, etc., against the target.
