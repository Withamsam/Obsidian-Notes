# [[Shodan]]  
___

## Description:
Shodan.io will try and connect to every device to gather information on it this does not just include webpages anything touching the internet it will try to scan.

## Installation
TheÂ **shodan**Â command-line interface (CLI) is packaged with the official Python library for Shodan, which means if you're running the latest version of the library you already have access to the CLI. To install the new tool simply execute:

```bash
easy_install shodan
```

Or if you're running an older version of the Shodan Python library and want to upgrade:

```bash
easy_install -U shodan
```

Once the tool is installed you have to initialize the environment with your API key usingÂ **shodan init**

```bash
shodan init YOUR_API_KEY
```

You can get your API key from your Shodan account page located at: [API KEY](https://account.shodan.io/)
