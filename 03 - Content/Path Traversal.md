## Example
### PHP
- `http://10.10.89.64/lab1.php?file=/etc/passwd`
	- We are feeding it the parameter of `file`
- **PHP 5.3.3** and below we can use **NULL BYTE** to tell the code being executed to ignore all the rest after this.
	- `%00` or `0x00`
	- Useful when the code we are trying to execute is having something added to the end.
