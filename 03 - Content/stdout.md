**Standard Output**(stdout) is as it sounds the standard output for programs. Not all programs use this though and sometimes we need to redirect streams.


## Output Redirection
### stdout -> file
```bash
ls -l > ls.txt
```

### stdout -> stderr
```bash
grep da * 1>&2
```

### stdout -> null
```
grep da * >/dev/null
```
