## Description:
This is an application that blends mind-mapping and OSINT. Typically you would start with a domain, company name,  email, person's name, etc. and transform this information into other bits of information. Maltego's term of transform is a peice of code that queries an API but not all of these queries are passive so be sure to know what it acutally does.
