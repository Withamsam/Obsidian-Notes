## Description:
Fast web fuzzer written in GO.

## Installation
### Kali
`sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffuf`

## Commands
### Basic
```bash
ffuf -w /path/to/wordlist -u http://{TARGET}/FUZZ
```


###
```bash
ffuf -w /path/to/wordlist -H "Host: FUZZ.{TARGET}" -u http://10.10.10.10 -fs {SIZE}
```
- Always returns valid so we need to filter by common sizes of replies.
	- Run 1 time without `-fs` cancel scan after a few seconds to get common "Size" that we want to ignore.


### Brute Enumeration Signup Page
```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -X POST -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.247.92/customers/signup -mr "username already exists"
```
- Example of enumerating a sign up form that requests a username, email, password, conformation password.


### Brute Forcing Login Page
```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -X POST -d "user=admin&pass=FUZZ" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://10.10.10.10/admin/index.php -ac -t 150
```
- Sometimes you need to find the *.php* file its going to as the above example is doing


### Enumerating Directories that Require Credentials
```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/directory_search.txt -u http://$RHOST:1234/manager/html/FUZZ -t 150 -b "JSESSIONID=DD5359630861ECD7807DB256FB428273" --recursion
```
- Once we have a successful sign in we can feed our requests with our session cookie with **-b** switch.
