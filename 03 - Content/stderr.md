# [[stderr]]  
**Standard error**(stderr) is an output stream that is usually used by programs to output error messages or diagnostics.

This is represented by `2>` if we want to redirect the str

- A few programs use this as the default out though such as:
	- [[Netcat]]


## Output Redirection
### stderr -> file
```bash
grep da * 2>
```
