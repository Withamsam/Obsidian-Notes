## Brute-Forcing HTTP Login
- Help menu command for syntax: `hydra http-get-form -U`
1. We need to gather what the **GET** / **POST** request looks like this can be done with Burp Suite or Developer Tools.
	- Below is showing us sending a failed request and we are looking for the **Request URL:** highlighted in the photo:
![[Pasted image 20230505170941.png]]
2. Now we can craft our attack command below is an example using the same **Request URL:** from the photo:
```bash
hydra -l burgess -P changed_clinic.lst 10.10.28.115 http-get-form "/login-get/index.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=Login failed" -f
```
- Explanation of each switch:
	- `-l` = Defining single username can be changed with `-L` for a list
	- `-P` = Defining a password list can be changed with `-p` for a single password
	- `10.10.28.115` = IP address for fully qualified domain name (FDQN)
	- `http-get-form` = Defines the type of request we are making can be changed with `http-post-form` if that is what their requests use
	- Next is the info we gathered from the Request URL:
		- `login-get/index.php` = Path to the login page on the target webserver
		- `username=^USER^&password=^PASS^` = We changed out the test username/password for `^USER^` & `^PASS^` these are what **hydra** uses to inject parameters
		- `:S=logout.php` = This help limit the false positives by telling hydra to check the response for a value to determine if we actually got in. This can be changed with `:F=<WHATEVER_WE_BELIVE_SHOULD_SHOW>`.
			- `:S=<WHATEVER_WE_BELIVE_SHOULD_SHOW>` = We are saying if we see what we input then we got in
			- `:F=<WHATEVER_WE_BELIVE_SHOULD_SHOW>` = We are saying we failed to get in

## Brute-Forcing HTTP Basic Authentication
- When security has a simple popup menu on a webpage
```bash
hydra -L user.list -P password.list 10.10.10.10 -m <PATH_TO_DIRECTORY> http-get
```
