## Description:
This is is a web-based tool that is designed to automate the act of **Phishing** by helping draft emails, collect analytics, host servers, etc...


## Commands
### Dashboard
- This contains a overview of all of our Campaigns

### Campaigns
- This is where we bring it all together. We create our actual attack using all the info we setup in the other tabs

### User & Groups
- This is where we store our targets email addresses for the automation

### Email Templates
- This is where we artfully craft our emails to trick the victim
- If we want to create **Anchor Text** we can do so under HTML tab click the `Link` button on the top enter what we want them to see and under **URL** enter `{{.URL}}` and set the protocol to `<other>`. This will tell the link to go to our custom landing page.

### Landing Pages
- This is where we configure the website page that the phishing email will lead to.
- Usually this is a spoof of an actual website that we are impersonating
- Written in HTML but we can attempt to steal this code directly from the site we are impersonating

### Sending Profiles
- These are the connection details **required** for actually sending our phishing emails. Simple its an **SMTP Sever** we have access too.
