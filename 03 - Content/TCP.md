## Description:  


## Flags
- **URG**: Urgent flag indicates that the urgent pointer filed is significant. The urgent pointer indicates that the incoming data is urgent, and that aÂ TCPÂ segment with the URG flag set is processed immediately without consideration of having to wait on previously sent TCP segments.
- **ACK**: Acknowledgement flag indicates that the acknowledgement number is significant. It is used to acknowledge the receipt of aÂ TCPÂ segment.
- **PSH**: Push flag askingÂ TCPÂ to pass the data to the application promptly.
- **RST**: Reset flag is used to reset the connection. Another device, such as a firewall, might send it to tear aÂ TCPÂ connection. This flag is also used when data is sent to a host and there is no service on the receiving end to answer.
- **SYN**: Synchronize flag is used to initiate aÂ TCPÂ 3-way handshake and synchronize sequence numbers with the other host. The sequence number should be set randomly during TCP connection establishment.
- **FIN**: The sender has no more data to send.
