## Combining Multiple Wordlists
1. First we will concatenate the desired list we can add as many as we want:
```bash
cat list1.txt list2.txt list3.txt > combined_list.txt
```
2. Next we will clean them up as they may have over lap and we don't want to waste time testing a password twice:
```bash
sort combined_list.txt | uniq -u > cleaned_combined_list.txt
```
- This search through the newly created password list and delete any duplicates

## Generating Username Wordlist From a Name List
1. This will assume that we have a {first name} {last name} in a list
2. We will use a pre-built Username Generator that will create most possible combinations:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/therodri2/username_generator.git
```
3. Next we will run the list through the generator and get our list of possible usernames to test against:
```bash
python username_generator -w <USERLIST.txt>
```
- Go out and try and make your own username generator!!!!

## Generating Wordlist From Known Information
1. We will use a pre-built automatic and interactive wordlist generator known as **CUPP** (Common User Password Profiler)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mebus/cupp.git
```
2. Now if you run `cupp.py` you will get the help menu but to start lets go directly into the **Interactive Mode**
```bash
python3 cupp.py -i
```
3. Follow the prompts and if we don't know the information about the target its asking for simply hit enter

## Keyspace Technique
This is when we create our own wordlist by feeding a tool parameters like letters, symbols, numbers, length, etc...
