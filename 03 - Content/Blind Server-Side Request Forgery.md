___

## Description:  
When an attacker is able to make the server request out to a malicious site of their choosing. Same as SSRF except we get no conformation in this case.

## HTTP logging tool
- Since the server itself isn't giving us a response we can use these tools to monitor requests
	- [Requestbin](https://requestbin.com/)
	- Our own HTTP server
	- Burp Suite
