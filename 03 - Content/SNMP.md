Used to collect information about various devices anything from servers with faulty disks to a printer low on ink. Thus it could contain a plethora of information if we can access it.

Offer no encryption for their traffic!!

## SNMP MIB Tree
- The SNMP Management Information Base (MIB) is a database containing information that is usually related to network management.
- This is built like a tree in which the branches represent a different organization or network function. All of the leaves on the tree correspond to specific variable values. These leaves can be enumerated by an external user.
