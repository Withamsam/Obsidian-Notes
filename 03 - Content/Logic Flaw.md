# [[Logic Flaw]]  
___

## Description:  
This is when the typical Logic Path is bypassed, circumvented or manipulated.
![[Pasted image 20221108155743.png]]

## Example
```php
if( url.substr(0,6) === '/admin') {
    # Code to check user is an admin
} else {
    # View Page
}
```
- Here we can see that the PHP code is checking if its redirecting to `/admin`. The flaw comes from the fact that its checking it with a three equal signs.
	- In PHP three equal signs means exactly matches this meaning `/AdMin` would not be checked further but would still let us access the admin account.
