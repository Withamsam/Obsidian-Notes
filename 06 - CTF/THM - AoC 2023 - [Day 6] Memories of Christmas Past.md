# Steps

1. Hitting `TAB` on your keyboard will open the debug menu. Here we see that its storing values using hexadecimal.
2. Start by farming on the computer by holding `SPACE` over it. Do this until you have `16 coins`
3. No go to the green character he will allow you to change your name. We can abuse this as the player name according to the debug menu should only allow 12 so make your name 16 in length
```
!!!!!!!!!!!!OOPS
```

4. If you set it to what we have above you should have the following amount of coins
```
1397772111
```
- This is the answer to the first question

5. Now try and buy the start from the blue goblin below you
6. Surprise he crafted this game to not be winnable so he gives you a "Rarer item"
7. Lets beat him we already know how to modify the game using the name changer. If you buy an item from the shop you need to enter an `id`.
8. You should see that whatever `id` you choose shoes in your inventory as its `id`
9. Go back to the name changer and enter the following name you need the name to be at least `44 in length`. I suggest going a bit over that incase you miss count.
```
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!e
```
- Make sure the last character you use is `e` which is the id of the star in the shop

10. All done go use that on the tree and you have the final flag.

We have only explored the surface of buffer overflows in this task. Buffer overflows are the basis of many public exploits and can even be used to gain complete control of a machine. If you want to explore this subject more in-depth, feel free to check theÂ [Buffer Overflows](https://tryhackme.com/room/bof1)Â room.
