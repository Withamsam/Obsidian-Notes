# Enumeration
## Port 80 (Golang)
- Located a download page with the source code. Looking it over we found a comment shown below:
	- **//A linear search is the best I can do, Steve says it's Oh Log N whatever that means**
- The about us page also indicates that they made this program because their passwords were compromised in the **rockyou**
	- This could mean that either the admin page or SSH has weak creds might want to try testing that???
	- [ ] SSH
	- [ ] Admin Page
		- **HINT 1 SAID TO NOT BRUTE FORCE**
- Possible usernames found on the about us page as well:
	- Ninja
	- Pars
	- Szymex
	- Bee
	- MuirlandOracle
		- Created a file in our directory with this list
