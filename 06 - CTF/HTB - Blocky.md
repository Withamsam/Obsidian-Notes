# Enumeration
## Port 80
1. Redirected to `http://blocky.htb`
	1. Had issues with this at first had to add `blocky.htb` to my `/etc/hostfiles`
2. Once in we found that its using WordPress 4.8 look into vulns for this and couldn't find anything that stands out
3. Running a [[ffuf]] scan found a few interesting subdomains
	- `/plugins`
		- BlockyCore.jar
			- Opening this up with an IDE we found creds
			- **notch:8YsqfCTnvxAUeduzjNSXe22**
		- grief prevention.jar 
	- `/wp-login`

# Exploitation
