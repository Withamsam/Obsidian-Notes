# Steps
1. Started with an *nmap* scan of the target
2. Located about a dozen ports open the ones of note are *21* and *80*
3. Using port *21* we can access this with anonymous user
	1. Once in we can navigate to `/Users/Public/`
		1. Using `cat user.txt` from here we get the users key
4. Next up we should check out what the website being hosted is
	1. We see it is a PRTG monitor running version *18.1.37.13946* found in the comment in source code of login page
		1. Searching for information about this version and we find that it is vulnerable to a *Authenticated RCE*
		2. Since we need to be authenticated I tried the default creds of `prtgadmin:prtgadmin` with no luck
		3. Now that we have an idea of a possible exploit lets see if we locate the creds stored on the target using the FTP connection we managed to get at the start
5. Going back to FTP sign in with anonymous user
	1. I googled where config for PRTG are stored and found it stores them under
		1. `C:\ProgramData\Paessler\PRTG Network Monitor`
		2. Navigating to this we see there was a backup created of the old config
		3. I downloaded all three that I found and started searching
		4. Under the `.old.bak` file I found a user of `prtgadmin:PrTg@dmin2018`
			1. I tried these on the website and they failed
			2. Thinking they might have updated the password since they created a backup of the configuration file I tweaked the "old pw" that we currently have
			3. Found that the following creds worked and allowed us in
				1. `prtgadmin:PrTg@dmin2019`
				2. They just updated the year which I like because its a very common thing for people to do when they need to constantly update passwords
6. Now that we have access to a *PRTG Administrator* we can try that RCE I found a script written in python that will callback to us and create a shell we simply need to give it our credentials and the target/callback IP/port
7. After giving those ran the command and it opened a shell
	1. My shell was a bit buggy giving error every so often but it would run commands no problem so I just moved forward
	2. Using `whoami` we find that we have a System user!!
	3. I went straight to the `C:/Users/Administrator/` folder and then moved into `/Desktop` since the main directory had not root.txt
	4. Success we found a *root.txt* file under the Desktop of the Admin user `print` was failing to work so used `more` instead to show the contents of the file
