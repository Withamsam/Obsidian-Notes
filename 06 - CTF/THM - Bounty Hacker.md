# Enumeration
## Port 80
- Webpage contained lore about the box but nothing else

## Port 21
- FTP server that allowed anonymous login.
	- Signing into it through that showed two text files
		- *locks.txt*
			- Possible password list
		- *task.txt*
			- More lore and contained a name of a possible *user: lin* 


---

# Exploitation
## Brute Force SSH
- Used the password list we found on the FTP server against the user lin and found the following
	- User: *lin*
	- Password: *RedDr4gonSynd1cat3*


---

# Lateral Movement to user
## Local Enumeration
- Located user.txt in the home of user *lin* via SSH

## Lateral Movement vector


---

# Privilege Escalation
## Local Enumeration
- `sudo -l` for user *lin* has access to run [[tar]]
	- GTFObins contained the following for how to escalate the user. 

## Privilege Escalation vector
```bash
sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
```

# Trophy & Loot

user.txt = *THM{CR1M3_SyNd1C4T3}*
root.txt = *THM{80UN7Y_h4cK3r}*
