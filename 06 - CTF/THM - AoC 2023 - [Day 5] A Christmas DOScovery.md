# Steps

1. Use `DIR` to display the `C:\` directory
	- This will give you the file size of `AC2023.BAK`
2. Navigate to `C:\TOOLS\BACKUP`
```bash
cd \TOOLS\BACKUP
```

3.  Print the contents of `README.txt`
```bash
type README.TXT
```
- This will give us the *name of the program* / *how to restore a file*

4. Now that we know how to restore a file lets do that using the MS-DOS editor
```bash
edit C:\AC2023.BAK
```

5. We need to alter the first two characters from `XX` --> `AC`
	- We get the `AC` from the read me file it tells us the first hex value should be `41 43` which is the hex value for `AC`
6. Run the backup program to read `AC2023.BAK`
```bash
C:\TOOLS\BACKUP\BUMASTER.EXE C:\AC2023.BAK
```

7. There's the flag!!
