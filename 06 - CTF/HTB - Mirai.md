# Enumeration
## Port 80
1. [[ffuf]] scan for subdomains showed us two:
	-  `/admin`
		- Redirects us to a Pi-Hole page!
	-  `/version`

## Pi-Hole
1. Once this was found I searched for exploits for its version but nothing interesting came up for that
2. Next I checked for default creds as we have a login page we could try
3. Found `pi:raspberry` tried those on the GUI and failed because it would only let me enter the password?
4. Shifted over to ssh into it to try the creds that way and success we are in!!

---

# Exploitation
## Default Credentials
1. Found default credentials were set for Pi-Hole and it allowed an ssh into it!!


---

# Lateral Movement to user
## Local Enumeration
- **pi** user
	- `sudo -l`
		- We have unrestricted access with this user!
	- Found **user.txt** under pi home directory

## Lateral Movement vector


---

# Privilege Escalation
## Local Enumeration
- **root.txt** turned out to be a bit more tricky when it comes to finding it:
	- Found under `/root/root.txt`
		- Contained instructions to check his USB drive
	- Checked under both `/mnt` & `/media`
		- Located under `/media/usbstick`
		- Once there we found `damnit.txt` which said "Sorry I deleted the USB drive wonder if there is  a way to recover that?"
			- Trying to find how to recover that I did a few `find` commands with no luck finally found an article that talked about checking `/dev/sdb`
			- Used `cat /dev/sdb` found a lot of gibberish but in there I could see mention of `usbstick` with what seemed like the flag and after testing it that was correct!
- **NOTE FOR FUTURE**
	- When looking for a deleted file under either sda, sdb, sdc, etc... use `strings sda` it will clean it up when showing in CLI

## Privilege Escalation vector
- Got an escalation simply with `sudo su` and entering the creds of the user we already had
