# Information Gathering
Scanned all TCP ports:
```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
```

Enumerated open TCP ports:
```bash

```

Enumerated top 200 UDP ports:
```bash

```

# Enumeration
## Port 80 - HTTP (Apache)
Located directory of `/panel/` with an upload form. After you upload it gives a link to where the file is saved `/uploads/{FILE NAME}`

---

# Exploitation
## PHP Reverse Shell
Uploaded a shell to the form `.php` failed. I was able to upload `.php3`, `.php4`, `.php7`, `.php-s` but each of these when navigating would open the file as text so the server wasn't executing them. Finally I tried `.phtml` it uploaded and when opening it under uploads directory it executed the code. With a **Netcat** listener opened the shell connected back.

# Lateral Movement to user
## Local Enumeration
Used the following command to locate the .txt flag `find . -name user.txt`

## Lateral Movement vector


---

# Privilege Escalation
## Local Enumeration
Running `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null` found that `usr/bin/python` had SUID set.

## Privilege Escalation vector
Navigated to `/usr/bin/` directory in the shell and ran `./python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")` which escalated my privilege to **ROOT**

# Trophy & Loot
user.txt = THM{y0u_g0t_a_sh3ll}

root.txt = THM{pr1v1l3g3_3sc4l4t10n}
